# Dagidirli
## Introduction
Remember the old days, when programs carried the name of it's developer? Like "roadkil's unstoppable copier"?
Let me introduce you to "Daniel Gilbert's Directory Listing" - or *Dagidirli*, if you like. Spin up the Docker, add a Github repo as source, and you are good to go. You can of course also just reference a local folder on the file system. It's totally up to you.
## History
*Dagidirli* started with the simple name of *Directory Listing* (ðŸ¥±) in 2019. It powered my [private website](https://g5t.de) ever since. I was tired of dealing with a full-blown CMS and didn't like the static page generators. I just want it to work, being lean and easy at the same time.

I also happen to like to build stuff. So there goes that.
## Features
- *TBD*
