## Introduction
*Radia* is inspired by the old days of Internet, where you would slab your web directory into the wild. Just start the Docker, add a Github repo as source, and you are good to go. You can of course also just reference a local folder on the file system. It's totally up to you.
## History
*Radia* started with the simple name of *Directory Listing* (ðŸ¥±) in 2019. It powered my [private website](https://g5t.de) ever since. I was tired of dealing with a full-blown CMS and didn't like the static page generators. I just want it to work, being lean and easy at the same time.

I also happen to like to build stuff. So there goes that.

The name comes from the likes of [Radia Perlman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radia_Perlman), who is most famous for the invention of the [Spanning Tree Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_Tree_Protocol). With this, she laid the foundation of what we nowadays refer to as "The Internet". Also, I like the name.
